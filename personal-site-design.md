What is your site's primary purpose? 

  To publish my work that I am completing with dev academy.
 
Who is your target audience? 

  Instructors and other students at dev academy, potential employers or anyone I want to demonstrate what I’ve learned to. 

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have? 

  They should be able to navigate anywhere in the site easily with as few steps as possible. The site should look good whilst being uncluttered. Information should be easy to read and responsive.
 
How will you build your site to support your desired user experience? 

  I will start by making a boxified design for how my site should look, then alter the HTML and CSS to implement the design. I will start my designs as mobile first, then adapt for other screens in the CSS.
